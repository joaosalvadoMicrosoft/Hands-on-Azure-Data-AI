# Lab 5: Ingest and Analyse real-time data with Event Hubs and Stream Analytics
In this lab you will use an Azure Logic App to simmulate high-frequency stock market of the NYSE. Every second the LogicApp generates a random number of stock purchase transactions with variable amounts for 5 of the biggest tech companies in the world. The LogicApp then sends stock transaction messages to Event Hubs. You will use Stream Analytics queries to join hot and cold data streams to process the high volume of transactions and generate aggregate calculations. The results will be sent to a real-time dataset in Power BI.

The estimated time to complete this lab is: **45 minutes**.

**IMPORTANT**: Some of the Azure services provisioned require globally unique name and a “-suffix” has been added to their names to ensure this uniqueness. Please take note of the suffix generated as you will need it for the following resources in this lab:

Name	                     |Type
-----------------------------|--------------------
syndtlake*suffix*	         |Storage Account
ADPEventHubs-*suffix*	     |Event Hubs Namespace
SynapseStreamAnalytics-*suffix*	 |Stream Analytics job

## Review the Azure LogicApp implementation

In this section you will review the implementation of the LogicApp used to simmulate high-frequency stock purchase transactions. These transactions will be formatted as JSON messages and sent to Event Hubs for processing. All steps required to generate the stock transaction messages have alreay been done for you and no further changes are required in this section.



1.	In the Azure Portal, go to the lab resource group and locate the Logic App resource **ADPLogicApp**.

2.	On the **ADPLogicApp** menu, click **Logic app designer** to open the design panel.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image67.png)

3.	On the **Logic app designer** panel, note that the **Recurrence** trigger is set to execute every 1 second:

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image12.png)

4.	The next two steps **Initialize Config Settings** and **Parse Config Settings** define the parameters used to generate the stock purchase messages.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image13.png)

5.	The **Initialize messageCount** step is used to initialize a variable used to count the number of messages generated. It's initial value is set to 1.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image14.jpg)

6.	In the **Until numberOfMessages is achieved** loop a piece of JavaScript is executed to generate the stock purchase transaction message. The message is then sent to the **nysestocktrade** Event Hub. The loop repeats its execution generating a random number of messages between 1 and 10 for every execution of the LogicApp.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image15.png)

7. The format of each stock purchase transaction message generated looks like this:

```json
{
  "StockTicker": "MSFT",
  "Quantity": 120,
  "Price": 83.63,
  "TradeTimestamp": "2019-11-24T00:21:50.207Z"
}
```

8. Return to the **Overview** panel. Note that the LogicApp is disabled by default. Click **Enable** to enable the LogicApp to start firing every second.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image68.png)


## Configure Capture for Event Hubs
In this section you will prepare Event Hubs to ingest NYSE stock trade messages generated by the LogicApp and save to your Synapse Data Lake account.




1.	In the Azure Portal, go to the lab resource group and locate the Event Hubs resource **ADPEventHubs-*suffix***. 

2.	On the **Event Hubs** panel, note that the **nysestocktrade** Event Hub has already been created for you. This is the same Event Hub you saw referenced by the LogicApp in the previous section. 

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image69.png)

3. Click on the **nysestocktrade** Event Hub to open its settings. Then click on the **Capture** item on the left-hand side menu.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image70.png)

4.	Enter the following details:
    <br>- **Capture**: On
    <br>- **Time window (minutes)**: 1
    <br>- **Do not emit empty files when no events occur during the capture time window**: Checked.
    <br>- **Capture Provider**: Azure Storage
    <br>- **Azure Storage Container**: [select the **nysestocktrade** container in your **syndtlake*suffix*** storage account]
7.	Leave remaining fields with their default values.
8.	Click **Save Changes**.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image71.png)

### Optional: Investigate NYCStockTrades Container contents

1. On your syndtlake account, navigate to the NYCStockTrades container you created in the previous section.

2. You should be able to see the folder structure created by Event Hubs Capture with AVRO files containing the individual stock purchase transaction messages generated by the LogicApp. These files can then be used in other analytics worlkloads whenever the granular detail about each individual transaction is required.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image72.png)


## Configure Stream Analytics Job
In this section you will configure your Stream Analytics job to join hot and cold data streams and execute queries on data sent by Event Hubs and generate outputs to Power BI.


1.	In the Azure Portal, go to the lab resource group and locate the Stream Analytics resource **SynapseStreamAnalytics-*suffix***. 

2.	On the Inputs panel, click **+ Add stream input** button and select **Event Hub** to create a new input stream.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image73.png)

3.	On the **Event Hub New input** blade enter the following details:
    <br>- **Input alias**: NYSEStockTrades
    <br>- **Event Hub namespace**: ADPEventHubs-suffix
    <br>- **Event Hub name > Use existing**: nysestocktrade
    <br>- **Event Hub Consumer Group > Create new**: NYSEStockTradesConsumer
    <br>- **Authentication mode**: Connection String

4.	Leave remaining fields with their default values.

    ![](./Media/Lab5-Image75.png)

5. Now click **+ Add reference input** button and select **SQL Database** to create a new reference data input stream.
